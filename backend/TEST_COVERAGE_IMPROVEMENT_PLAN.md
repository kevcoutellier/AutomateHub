# AutomateHub Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current Status Analysis

Based on the test coverage report showing 19.37% statement coverage and 41 failed tests, here's a comprehensive improvement plan:

### Current Coverage Breakdown
- **Overall Statement Coverage**: 19.37%
- **Branch Coverage**: 15.35%
- **Function Coverage**: 11.79%
- **Line Coverage**: 19.32%
- **Failed Tests**: 41/76 (54% failure rate)

### Critical Areas Requiring Immediate Attention

#### 1. Routes Coverage (16.92% â†’ Target: 80%)
**Current Issues:**
- Most route handlers have 0% coverage
- Missing error handling tests
- Authentication/authorization not properly tested

**Immediate Actions:**
- âœ… Created unit tests for auth routes
- âœ… Created unit tests for experts routes  
- âœ… Created unit tests for projects routes
- ðŸ”„ Need to fix Jest configuration issues
- ðŸ”„ Need to resolve database connection problems

#### 2. Services Coverage (8.01% â†’ Target: 90%)
**Current Issues:**
- StatisticsService: 0% coverage
- NotificationService: 7.24% coverage
- DatabaseOptimizationService: 20% coverage

**Immediate Actions:**
- âœ… Created comprehensive service unit tests
- ðŸ”„ Need to fix MongoDB Memory Server setup
- ðŸ”„ Need to mock external dependencies

#### 3. Models Coverage (51.76% â†’ Target: 85%)
**Current Issues:**
- Assessment.ts: 0% coverage
- Report.ts: 0% coverage
- Review.ts: 30.35% coverage

**Immediate Actions:**
- Create model validation tests
- Test pre/post hooks
- Test schema constraints

#### 4. Middleware Coverage (32.03% â†’ Target: 95%)
**Current Issues:**
- rateLimiting.ts: 0% coverage
- versioning.ts: 0% coverage
- performance.ts: 0% coverage

**Immediate Actions:**
- âœ… Created middleware unit tests
- ðŸ”„ Need to test rate limiting scenarios
- ðŸ”„ Need to test error handling paths

## Technical Issues to Resolve

### 1. Jest Configuration
**Problem**: Jest types not properly recognized
**Solution**: 
- âœ… Installed @types/jest
- âœ… Updated jest.config.js
- âœ… Created jest.d.ts for global types

### 2. Database Setup
**Problem**: MongoDB Memory Server connection issues
**Solution**:
- Update setup.ts with proper error handling
- Add connection retry logic
- Implement proper cleanup

### 3. JWT Token Generation
**Problem**: Type errors in JWT sign method
**Solution**:
- âœ… Fixed expiresIn type casting
- Ensure config.jwt.secret is properly typed

## Immediate Action Items

### Phase 1: Fix Foundation (Week 1)

   - Test basic test execution

2. **Fix Database Connection**
   - Update MongoDB Memory Server setup
   - Add proper error handling
   - Test database operations

3. **Fix Authentication Tests**
   - Resolve JWT token generation
   - Test auth middleware
   - Validate user creation

### Phase 2: Expand Unit Tests (Week 2)
1. **Complete Route Testing**
   - Add missing route handlers
   - Test error scenarios
   - Validate request/response formats

2. **Service Layer Testing**
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Test business logic
   - Validate error handling

3. **Model Testing**
   - Test validations
   - Test hooks and middleware
   - Test relationships

### Phase 3: Integration Testing (Week 3)
1. **Fix Existing Integration Tests**
   - Resolve hanging tests
   - Fix database conflicts
   - Improve test isolation

2. **Add Missing Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end workflows
   - API contract testing
   - Performance testing

## Test Commands for Development

```bash
# Run specific test types
npm run test:unit           # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration    # Integration tests only
npm run test:coverage       # Full coverage report

# Debug failing tests
npm run test:debug          # Verbose output
npm run test:fix            # Force exit for hanging tests

# Run specific test files
npx jest tests/unit/auth.unit.test.ts
npx jest tests/unit/experts.unit.test.ts
npx jest tests/unit/projects.unit.test.ts

# Run with specific patterns
npx jest --testNamePattern="Auth Routes"
npx jest --testPathPattern="unit"
```

## Coverage Targets by Module

| Module | Current | Target | Priority |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| Routes | 16.92% | 80% | High |
| Services | 8.01% | 90% | High |
| Models | 51.76% | 85% | Medium |
| Middleware | 32.03% | 95% | High |
| Utils | 11.23% | 80% | Medium |

## Success Metrics

### Short Term (1 Week)
- [ ] All unit tests pass without hanging
- [ ] Statement coverage > 40%
- [ ] Zero TypeScript compilation errors in tests

### Medium Term (2 Weeks)
- [ ] Statement coverage > 60%
